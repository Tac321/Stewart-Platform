# Stewart Platform Simulation
Simulation environment of MATLAB is used to model Stewart Platform, for graphing leg actuation. This was done to ensure that the real simulator
legs don't exceed maximum excursion within the operational envelop.


## How to run
Open "StewLegLog.m" and press F5. A GUI will pop up and you can edit the attutide or translation of the simulation and view the leg actuation.
